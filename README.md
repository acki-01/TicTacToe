# Angular vs React Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This game was prepared as final project on Coders Lab's "Become Junior Front-End Developer" bootcamp.</br></br>
Link: https://arkadiuszizycki.github.io/TicTacToe/</br></br> Technology I've used:
  - ReactJS
  - ES6
  - SASS
  - Gulp (beginning)
  - Webpack
  
In a future I want to add logic for playing with computer.
 ### _Enjoy!_
